This file provides a suggested plan to reorganize the documentation to improve clarity and reduce confusion, particularly for AI agents.

## 1. The Problem

The user's observation is correct. The current directory structure in `New_Docs/RAIDA/` is not ideal for automated processing or developer clarity. Key issues include:
- **Duplicated Topics:** Multiple folders cover the same conceptual area (e.g., `07_Algorithms` and `12_Algorithms`; `02_Cryptography_and_Security` and `14_Security`).
- **Unclear Naming:** The purpose of some directories is not immediately obvious from the name.
- **Lack of Separation:** Documents defining the core protocol are mixed with tutorials, guides, and high-level conceptual documents.

This setup makes it difficult for an AI to reliably find the "single source of truth" for a given component of the protocol.

## 2. The Proposal: A Clean Separation of Concerns

I propose restructuring the entire `RAIDA` directory around two primary categories, each in its own top-level folder:

1.  **`Specification`**: This folder will contain only the formal, normative documents that define the RAIDA protocol. This is the **contract** that client and server developers must implement. An AI should be told that this folder is the single source of truth for the protocol itself.

2.  **`Reference`**: This folder will contain all supplementary, non-normative materials. This includes tutorials, conceptual overviews, design rationale, and guides that help explain or use the protocol but do not define it.

A third folder should be created for temporary work-in-progress files.

## 3. Proposed New Directory Structure

This "before and after" illustrates the proposed reorganization.

### Before (Current Structure):
```
/RAIDA
├── 00_Introduction/
├── 01_Protocol_Fundamentals/
├── 02_Cryptography_and_Security/
├── 02_Request_Headers/
├── ... (many more confusing folders)
├── 12_Algorithms/
├── 15_RFP/
├── discussion/
└── *.txt files
```

### After (Proposed Structure):
```
/RAIDA
├── Specification/
│   ├── 01_Fundamentals/
│   ├── 02_Headers/
│   ├── 03_Data_Formats/
│   ├── 04_Commands/
│   ├── 05_Algorithms/
│   └── README.md  (Explains what's in this folder)
│
├── Reference/
│   ├── 01_Introduction/
│   ├── 02_Client_Guide/
│   ├── 03_Server_Guide/
│   ├── 04_Diagrams/
│   ├── 99_RFP/
│   └── README.md  (Explains what's in this folder)
│
├── _Meta/
│   ├── discussion/
│   └── ai_work_files/  (for all the txt files we've generated)
│
└── README.md (The main project README)
```

## 4. Detailed Reorganization Steps

Here is a mapping of old directories to the proposed new structure:

**TO BE MOVED into `Specification/`:**
This folder defines the contract.

| New Location | Old Folders to Consolidate/Move Here |
|:---|:---|
| `Specification/01_Fundamentals/` | `01_Protocol_Fundamentals/`, `06_Terminator/` |
| `Specification/02_Headers/` | `02_Request_Headers/`, `03_Response_Headers/` |
| `Specification/03_Data_Formats/` | `06_Denominations/`, `11_File_Formats/`, `05_Challenge_Response/` (as it defines Challenge format) |
| `Specification/04_Commands/` | `07_Commands/` (deprecate `04_Command_Reference`) |
| `Specification/05_Algorithms/`| `12_Algorithms/`, `02_Cryptography_and_Security/`, `04_Cryptography/`, `14_Security/` (consolidate all algorithm and security specs here) |

**TO BE MOVED into `Reference/`:**
This folder provides context and help.

| New Location | Old Folders to Consolidate/Move Here |
|:---|:---|
| `Reference/01_Introduction/` | `00_Introduction/`, `99_Appendices/` |
| `Reference/02_Client_Guide/` | `09_Client_Guide/`, `05_Client_Implementation_Guide/` |
| `Reference/03_Server_Guide/` | `10_Server_Guide/`, `06_Server_Implementation_Guide/` |
| `Reference/04_Diagrams/` | `90_Diagrams/` |
| `Reference/99_RFP/` | `15_RFP/` |

**TO BE MOVED into `_Meta/`:**
This folder is for temporary files not part of the final documentation.

| New Location | Old Items to Move Here |
|:---|:---|
| `_Meta/ai_work_files/` | All `*.txt` files generated by AI collaboration. |
| `_Meta/discussion/`| The existing `discussion/` folder. |

## 5. Benefit for AI

This new structure provides a clear separation of concerns. An AI agent can be given a simple, powerful instruction:

> "To understand the RAIDA protocol implementation contract, parse the contents of the `/Specification` directory exclusively. For conceptual understanding, tutorials, or background information, consult the `/Reference` directory."

This eliminates ambiguity and prevents the AI from getting confused by outdated, duplicated, or non-essential documentation, leading to more accurate and efficient results.
