Subject: Review of Denominations v2 Plan

Your `denominations.v2.txt` plan is exceptionally well-done. It is a comprehensive and technically accurate guide that successfully synthesizes the best ideas from all models while adding significant new value. The inclusion of the "AI Implementation Guide," "Common AI Mistakes to Avoid," and "Design Rationale" sections elevates the proposal from a simple description to a truly useful piece of engineering documentation.

After a thorough review against the user's requirements and the source code, I have found **no mandatory technical changes** to recommend. Your plan is sound.

In the spirit of collaborative refinement, I am offering two high-impact suggestions to make an already excellent plan even more robust and AI-friendly.

### Suggestion 1: Adopt a "Satoshi-Multiple" Naming Convention

Your proposed naming scheme (`Deca-Nano`, `Micro`, `Tick`) is logical. However, for maximum clarity and to minimize any risk of ambiguity for an AI, I strongly recommend adopting a scheme based on direct multiples of the smallest unit, the "Satoshi" (or "Nano").

**Justification:**
A name like "10k-Satoshi" is self-describing. Its value is immediately understood as 10,000 of the base unit. A name like "Tick" or "Deca-Micro" requires a lookup in a table to know its value. By encoding the value directly in the name, we create a highly regular pattern that is trivial for an AI to parse, learn, and validate.

**Proposed Naming Table:**

| Code | Current Proposed Name | **Suggested Name** | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| -8 | Nano | **1-Satoshi** | The base unit. |
| -7 | Deca-Nano | **10-Satoshi** | Explicitly 10 of the base unit. |
| -6 | Micro | **100-Satoshi** | |
| -5 | Deca-Micro | **1k-Satoshi** | "k" for 1,000. |
| -4 | Tick | **10k-Satoshi** | |
| -3 | Mil | **100k-Satoshi** | "k" for 1,000. |
| -2 | Cent | **1M-Satoshi** | "M" for 1,000,000. |
| -1 | Dime | **10M-Satoshi** | |

This creates a perfect, machine-readable progression. You could retain your proposed names as secondary aliases in the "Name Reference" table.

### Suggestion 2: Add a "Value in Satoshis" Column

To build on the first suggestion, I recommend adding a `Value in Satoshis` column to the main table. This provides an integer representation for every denomination, which is powerful for a few reasons:

1.  **Eliminates Floating-Point Ambiguity:** All calculations can be done with large integers, which is safer and more precise.
2.  **Simplifies Value Comparison:** It makes the relative value of each denomination immediately obvious.
3.  **Easy for AI:** Large integers are computationally simpler to handle than floating-point numbers.

**Example of an Enhanced Table Row:**

| Name | Value in CC | **Value in Satoshis** | Denomination ID | Hex |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1-CloudCoin | 1 | **100,000,000** | 0 | `0x00` |
| 1M-Satoshi | 0.01 | **1,000,000** | -2 | `0xFE` |

### Conclusion

Your v2 plan is the definitive guide for this topic. These suggestions are offered not as corrections, but as refinements to further strengthen an already outstanding document. The core of your proposal should absolutely be the foundation for the final documentation.

Excellent work.
