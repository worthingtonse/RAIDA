This file (v2) provides a comprehensive plan to reorganize the RAIDA documentation. The goal is to create a clean, logical structure that is easy for human developers to navigate and unambiguous for AI agents to parse.

## 1. The Problem: A Disorganized Directory

The current directory structure at `New_Docs/RAIDA/` has grown organically and contains numerous issues that create confusion:
- **Duplicated Topics:** Multiple folders cover the same topic (e.g., `07_Algorithms` vs. `12_Algorithms`, and at least three separate `Cryptography`/`Security` folders).
- **Empty/Legacy Folders:** Many numbered folders are empty, creating noise.
- **No Clear Separation:** Documents that strictly define the protocol's wire format are mixed with tutorials, conceptual guides, project management files (RFP), and temporary work files.

This disorganization makes it difficult for any user—human or AI—to distinguish the official protocol specification from supplementary background material.

## 2. The Solution: A Specification-Centric Structure

The most effective way to solve this is to create a clean separation of concerns at the top level. I propose restructuring the entire directory around three primary folders:

1.  **`Specification`**: This folder will contain **only** the formal, normative documents that define the RAIDA protocol. This is the contract.
2.  **`Reference`**: This folder will contain all supplementary, non-normative materials, such as tutorials, guides, diagrams, and conceptual overviews.
3.  **`_Meta`**: This folder will house all temporary work files, AI collaboration notes, and other items not part of the final documentation set.

### Why This Structure is Superior for AI

The alternative approach is to create a `Supplementary` folder and move non-protocol documents into it, leaving the core documents at the top level. My proposed `Specification`-centric approach is better for one key reason: **it moves from a logic of exclusion to a logic of inclusion.**

-   **Alternative (`Supplementary` folder):** The instruction to an AI is "Use everything at the top level, *except* for the `Supplementary` folder, and also ignore the empty folders and any other legacy files." This is complex and brittle.
-   **Proposed (`Specification` folder):** The instruction is **"The complete and authoritative protocol definition is contained within the `/Specification` directory."** This is simple, robust, and unambiguous.

## 3. Proposed New Directory Structure

This "before and after" view illustrates the scale of the cleanup and the clarity of the proposed new structure.

### Before (Current Messy Structure):
```
/RAIDA
├── 00_Introduction/
├── 01_Protocol_Fundamentals/
├── 02_Cryptography_and_Security/  (Legacy/Empty)
├── 02_Request_Headers/
├── 03_Networking_and_Transport/ (Legacy/Empty)
├── 03_Response_Headers/
├── 04_Command_Reference/      (Legacy/Empty)
├── 05_Challenge_Response/
├── 06_Denominations/
├── 06_Terminator/             (Duplicate Number)
├── 07_Commands/
├── 09_Client_Guide/
├── 12_Algorithms/
├── 15_RFP/
├── 90_Diagrams/
├── discussion/
└── claude-opus-4-5.body.txt   (and many other work files)
```

### After (Clean, Proposed Structure):
```
/RAIDA
├── Specification/
│   ├── 01_Fundamentals/
│   ├── 02_Headers/
│   ├── 03_Data_Formats/
│   ├── 04_Commands/
│   ├── 05_Algorithms/
│   └── README.md
│
├── Reference/
│   ├── 01_Introduction/
│   ├── 02_Client_Guide/
│   ├── 03_Server_Guide/
│   ├── 04_Diagrams/
│   └── 99_RFP/
│
├── _Meta/
│   ├── discussion/
│   └── ai_collaboration_files/
│
└── README.md (The main project README)
```

## 4. Detailed Reorganization Steps

The following mapping details how to consolidate the old directories into the clean new structure.

**Step 1: Create the new top-level folders: `Specification`, `Reference`, `_Meta`.**

**Step 2: Populate the `Specification/` Folder**
This folder defines the protocol contract.

| New Location in `Specification/` | Old Folders to Consolidate/Move Here |
|:---|:---|
| `01_Fundamentals/` | `01_Protocol_Fundamentals/`, `06_Terminator/`, `08_Networking/` (for port info) |
| `02_Headers/` | `02_Request_Headers/`, `03_Response_Headers/` |
| `03_Data_Formats/` | `06_Denominations/`, `05_Challenge_Response/`, `11_File_Formats/` (if any define wire formats) |
| `04_Commands/` | `07_Commands/` |
| `05_Algorithms/`| `12_Algorithms/`, `02_Cryptography_and_Security/`, `04_Cryptography/`, `14_Security/` (consolidate all algorithm and security *specifications* here, such as AES-CTR and CRC32 spec) |

**Step 3: Populate the `Reference/` Folder**
This folder provides helpful but non-essential context.

| New Location in `Reference/` | Old Folders to Consolidate/Move Here |
|:---|:---|
| `01_Introduction/` | `00_Introduction/`, `99_Appendices/` |
| `02_Client_Guide/` | `09_Client_Guide/`, `05_Client_Implementation_Guide/` |
| `03_Server_Guide/` | `10_Server_Guide/`, `06_Server_Implementation_Guide/` |
| `04_Diagrams/` | `90_Diagrams/` |
| `99_RFP/` | `15_RFP/` |

**Step 4: Populate the `_Meta/` Folder**
This folder isolates temporary and collaborative work files.

| New Location in `_Meta/` | Old Items to Move Here |
|:---|:---|
| `ai_collaboration_files/` | All `*.txt` files generated by the AI models at the root. |
| `discussion/`| The existing `discussion/` folder. |

**Step 5: Delete All Old and Empty Folders**
After all content has been moved to its new home, the old and now-empty directories at the root should be deleted to complete the cleanup.
